# Bangalore-House-Price-Predictor
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices in Bangalore based on the total area (in square feet) of the property. The dataset contains information about various properties, including the house size and the corresponding price. This model uses the `scikit-learn` library to build and train the linear regression model and `matplotlib` to visualize the results.

## Features
- Predict house prices based on the total area (in square feet).
- Clean data by converting square footage ranges to average values.
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices in a scatter plot.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
